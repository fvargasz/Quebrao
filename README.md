# Quebrao

Quebrao is a budgetting iphone app born from the necesity that people have of tracking their expenses while being able to allocate that expense for a certain category. The motivation for this app is to satisfacy the user's basic necesities while not hiding any functionaly behind a paywall. The idea is to make the app to rely on the limitations that it's running device offers.

# Tech Stack

I decided to make the app in swiftUI since Apple is pushing the utilization of swiftUI. I wanted to learn how to use the framework since I had previous experience on working with swift. The app was completely build using swiftUI without the utilization of external libraries. The app original purpose was to help me track my expenses in my own phone without needing to have a server.

# Set up
To run the project it is required to have a system with MacOS that can run iOS devices with version 17.6 or newer. First, to run Quebrao, open the solution file and build the application. Next, it is needed to select a device to emulate the app for running. Finally, run the build previouly done on XCode, this will install the app in the simulation deviced previously selected.

# Contribute
To contribute on the app feel free to fork the project, add the changes that seems fitting, add create the pull request. Or contact me to suggest ideas. 

# The future
In next iterations of the app I'm planning to add:
* Multiple language support: currently Quebrao is build upon mixing english and spanish. Adding the ability to decide which language to use or have it base on the device can improve the user experience
* Ensure data transfer of the transactions: in the case that the user wants to change their device. Quebrao should be able to transfer the data from one phone to the other.
