# Quebrao

Quebrao is a free budgeting iPhone app where users can track and categorize their expenses. The motivation for this app is to satisfy the user's basic necessities while not hiding any functionality behind a paywall.

## Tech Stack

The app is built using SwiftUI, leveraging Apple's recommended framework for modern UI development. The transactions and categories are stored using Core Data for persistent storage.

## Set up

Quebrao requires a system capable of running iOS 17.6 or newer. Follow these steps to run the application:
- Open the solution file and build the application.
- Select a device to emulate the app for running.
- Run the build previously done on Xcode; this will install the app on the simulation device previously selected.

## Contribute

To contribute to the app, feel free to fork the project, add the changes that seem fitting, and create the pull request. Or contact me to suggest ideas.

## The future

In next iterations of the app, I'm planning to add:
- **Multiple language support**: currently, Quebrao is built upon mixing English and Spanish. Adding the ability to decide which language to use or have it based on the device can improve the user experience.
- **Ensure data transfer of the transactions**: in case the user wants to change their device. Quebrao should be able to transfer the data from one phone to the other.
